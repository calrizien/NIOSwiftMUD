# NIOSwiftMUD

This is the code repository for the tutorial series where we're using Swift and NIO to create a MUD game.

Note: this project uses the new concurrency features in Swift 5.5, so requires macOS 12 Monterey to build and run on macOS.

Feel free to create issues if you find any bugs.

## Episodes:
* Ep 01: Echo Server: basic setup of a NIO project.
* Ep 02: Pipeline: create a channel pipeline, fit for use with a MUD game.
* Ep 03: User database: create a generic, asynchron o us backend to persist data in the game. And let players create users.
* Ep 04: Small cleanup (1): create a welcome message and add password hashing.
