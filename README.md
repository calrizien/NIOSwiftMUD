# NIOSwiftMUD

This is the code repository for the tutorial series where we're using Swift and NIO to create a MUD game.

You can find the playlist for the tutorials here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhUrOtMlcKDAa0_WYh_J4vQ6Lzw0DvLLK

Feel free to create issues if you find any bugs.

## YouTube series release

Use the release: https://github.com/maartene/NIOSwiftMUD/releases/tag/YouTube to get the source code after the YouTube series (without subsequent improvements).

## Changes after YouTube series

Note: changes have been made after the YouTube series. In particular:

- Commands are no longer enum based, and no longer parsed in switch statements. Commands are now a protocol that specific commands can adhere to. In other words, we now use polymorphism to steer behaviour.
- `Session` is now a Protocol, whereas the `MudSession` is a specific implementation (that keeps track of channels). This way, the model is no longer dependant on knowledge about NIO, offering the option of stand alone testing.
- `SessionStorage` is now part of the model and works on generic instances of the `Session` protocol instead of concrete type.
- Doors (use the 'OPEN_DOOR <direction>' command.
- Backspace support! ðŸŽ‰

## Episodes:

- Ep 01: Echo Server: basic setup of a NIO project.
- Ep 02: Pipeline: create a channel pipeline, fit for use with a MUD game.
- Ep 03: User database: create a generic, asynchronous backend to persist data in the game. And let players create users.
- Ep 04: Small cleanup (1): create a welcome message and add password hashing.
- Ep 05: Sessions: associate players with sessions and allow players to log in.
- Ep 06: Rooms: add rooms to the game and let players look around.

- Ep 08: Movement: allow players to move from room to room.
- Ep 09: Notifications: notify other (logged in) players (in a room) of actions by the player.
- Ep 10: Speak: let players speak out loud.
